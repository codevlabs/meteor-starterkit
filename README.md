## LESS Structure
The way I have this structured is that all LESS files get imported into the ```style.less``` file.
So, all of the files are named ```filename.import.less``` and then imported in the order it should go in.
This way, you are more organized with the order and usage of your LESS styles.

This methodology just made sense to me, but if you have a suggestion / reasoning why I should change it, please feel free to open an issue.

## Why?
So, I know there are other 'starter kits' or 'boilerplates' out there for Meteor, but I
wanted one that was a little different. That is why I created this one that is heavily influenced
by Bootstrap, but does come with some components I expect to use on newer projects.

## Installation

You should have [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and [Meteorite](https://atmospherejs.com/docs/installing) installed then follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository locally
2. run ```mrt```

## But... what about X

If you have something that you would like added, please open up an issue or even a pull request directly.
I am open to suggestions.
